## Notes

### SHA-256 Algorithm

SHA Stands for:

-   Secure
-   Hashing
-   Algorithm

256 References the number of bits in the hashed output value from the algorithm (32-bytes)

The algorithm produces a unique 32 byte value for a given unique input.

_(Note: values range from 0 to 2<sup>256</sup> - 1, or really really big!!!)_

This creates a one way hash from data to hash value (e.g. "Some text to be hashed" -> 100101110100101011101...0, cannot be decrypted back into original text)
